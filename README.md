# Learning Analytics Regressions
### Contains a Jupyter Notebook (2023)
This program analyses student education data and attempts to predict the students results based on a wide range of parameters. To predict the scores we first use linear regression and then a neural network model. It's found that the future grades are very difficult to predict from the dataset provided.
